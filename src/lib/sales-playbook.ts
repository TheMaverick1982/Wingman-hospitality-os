// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Sales / demo playbook.
//
// Reference material for platform staff who run demos of Wingman for restaurant
// operators. It is curated by us and maintained in code (like the Help Center),
// shared across all demo staff. Rendered read-only at /admin/sales-training.
//
// The whole ethos: we are a guide, not a closer. Everything here is a guardrail,
// never a script to read word-for-word. If Wingman isn't right for an operator,
// the rep should say so — one honest "not yet" beats a bad-fit sale every time.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// A new rep should be able to learn what Wingman actually is from this section
// alone — before they ever run a demo. Keep this in plain, operator-facing
// language: what it is, why it matters, and what each part does.
